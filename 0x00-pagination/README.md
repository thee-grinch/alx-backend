# Pagination Implementation

## Introduction
Pagination is a common technique used in web development to divide large sets of data into smaller, more manageable chunks. It allows users to navigate through the data in a structured manner, improving the overall user experience.

## How Pagination Works
Pagination typically involves two main components: the server-side implementation and the client-side integration.

### Server-Side Implementation
1. Retrieve the total number of records in the dataset.
2. Determine the number of records to display per page.
3. Calculate the total number of pages based on the total number of records and the records per page.
4. Implement a mechanism to fetch the relevant subset of data based on the current page number and the records per page.
5. Return the paginated data to the client.

### Client-Side Integration
1. Display the paginated data to the user.
2. Create navigation elements such as previous and next buttons, as well as page number links.
3. Handle user interactions, such as clicking on a page number or the previous/next buttons.
4. Send requests to the server to fetch the relevant data based on the user's actions.
5. Update the displayed data with the newly fetched results.

## Example Code
Here's an example code snippet in JavaScript to demonstrate a basic implementation of pagination on the server-side using Node.js and Express:
